# DATA_PROCESSING
This question involves data analysis, handling missing values and outliers, data visualization, and statistical computations using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Python.
This question covers various data analysis and statistical tasks using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. It involves working with datasets, handling missing values and outliers, performing data smoothening, compression, and normalization using Pandas functions.

The question also includes tasks related to data visualization using different types of charts like bar charts, pie charts, line charts, histograms, stem-leaf displays, ogive charts, and dot plots. For bivariate data, scatter plots with trendlines are used to explore relationships between variables and develop simple linear regression models.

Additionally, the question involves writing programs to compute various statistical measures for univariate data, such as mean, median, mode, percentiles, quartiles, and measures of variation like range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variance.

Furthermore, the question covers the implementation of binomial, Poisson, and hypergeometric probability distributions, along with computing probabilities, plotting distributions, and calculating expected values and variances.

Overall, the question aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of data analysis, visualization, and statistical concepts, and it requires using Python programming to perform these tasks efficiently.
